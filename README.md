## My personal installation script and configurations.

It's currently set up to install on a previously installed Antergos base (without X). A small script on a usb thumb drive sets up my ssh config and keys, then pulls down this dotfiles repo and starts the install.sh script.

When xorg and i3-gaps is installed, it starts X and continues the installation in the i3 environment.
