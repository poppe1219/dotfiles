## My personal installation script and configurations.

It's currently set up to install on a previously installed Antergos base (without X). A small script on a usb thumb drive sets up my ssh config and keys, then pulls down this dotfiles repo and starts the install.sh script.

Note to self:
When installing in a vitualbox machine, insall virtualbox-guest-modules-arch. It will ask to uninstall virtualbox-guest-dkms.
